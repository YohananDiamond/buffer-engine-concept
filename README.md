# Buffer Engine (Concept)

**Note**: This is a work in progress and anything is subject to change.

This is the concept of a project I've been working on. It consists on an
extensible environment that can be used in many different ways, and not
only for text editing.

Some of the core principles are:

- (Almost) everything is a module. Modules can be added or removed, and
  with that the user may decide to replace most core modules in favor of
  what they prefer.

- It should be portable. The environment should work in any major
  desktop platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows etc.).

<!-- Talk about portability in USB somewhere else -->
